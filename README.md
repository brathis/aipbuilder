# AIP Builder

A tool for building geospatial datasets from textual aeronautical information publications (AIPs).

## Why?

I have been wanting to build my own EFB/flight planning app for Switzerland for a while. However, obtaining the official aeronautical information
for Switzerland (i.e. airspaces, VFR reporting points, navaids, frequencies, etc.) in a machine-readable format has turned out to be nearly impossible.
So, out of frustration, I decided to build my own dataset, which is where this tool comes into play.
